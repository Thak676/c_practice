This is for my personal use, practicing C and C++.

Compile binaries by running 'make' in the root directory of the project.

I intend to implement leetcode-style files with corresponding unit tests.

As of this writing I am using the catch2 testing framework.

For a good video on unit testing (it is C++ but the general ideas apply to all languages imo):
